# Scripts

This is a required folder for `create-react-app` to be able to initialize a new
repository using `esbuild-scripts`.

The `init.js` is a wrapper around `react-scripts/scripts/init.js` which facilitates
the creation of a repository using a template and then removes the `react-scripts`
dependencies.
